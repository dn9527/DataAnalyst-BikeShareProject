## Project Description

The goal of this project is to analyze bike sharing data and uncover patterns and trends related to user behavior and preferences. The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization to present the findings.


## Data

The data used for this analysis is sourced from the XYZ Bike Sharing Company. It includes information on ride duration, start and end locations (latitude and longitude), user type (casual or member), and bike type (classic bike or electric bike).

The raw data is stored in the `data` directory, and the processed data is available in the `processed_data` directory.

## Results

The analysis of the bike sharing data revealed several interesting insights:

- Popular routes: The most frequently used routes by both casual and member users were identified and visualized on a map.
- User behavior: Patterns in ride duration, preferred days of the week, and bike type usage were analyzed.
- User types: The distribution of rides between casual and member users was examined, along with their preferences and differences in behavior.

For detailed findings and visualizations, please refer to the project report.
